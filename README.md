# Text editor build in C</h1>

## Purpose

* Allows user to:
* 	Create a new file, can be a programming or other regular text file


### Usage:
- Clone repo
- Open terminal in folder where you cloned the repo
- Run the application `./fte`

### Considerations:
- When creating a file, the first line of the file is the file's name
	- For example: 
		- Line 1: hello.py
		- Line 2: print("hello, world")
- To exit the program and save your file, hit buttons `cntrl+D` at the same time
- To view a file, use `cat, less, more or nano`

### Fearues coming soon:
- Ability to modify already created file
- Ability to `delete` after hitting the `return` key
- Piping things into the text editor, like how `cat, less, more and others` work
- Integration with `less or cat`commands so that reading files is made more simply (not sure if this is needed yet)
